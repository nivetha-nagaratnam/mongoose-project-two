# Project 2 Node/Express/MongoDB Full-stack CRUD Application

## **App Title** 

The Our Little Secret is a full-stack CRUD app that allows users to find makeup products and their dupes. There are a very few websites that showcase this 
information to users. This app was created to allow users to view and upload products and their dupes, so that they can save some money. Here's to hoping Our Little Secret App will create a money saving makeup community!

## **Technologies Used** 

Technologies used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## **Next Steps** 

Some next steps for this game would be adding animations and making a mobile version. I would add animations to show when a player wins or loses. I would also try to animate the process of 
losing lives in the game.
