# Project 2 Node/Express/MongoDB Full-stack CRUD Application

## **App Title** 

Our Little Secret is a full-stack CRUD app that allows users to find makeup products and their dupes. There are a very few websites that showcase this 
information to users. This app was created to allow users to view and upload products and their dupes, so that they can save some money. Here's to hoping Our Little Secret App will create a money saving makeup community!

## **Next Steps** 

Some next steps for this app would be to work on the styling a bit more. I would also like to add delete buttons to reviews, images, and dupes.
